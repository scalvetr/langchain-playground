<h1>Understanding OpenAI</h1>
<div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization founded in December 2015. Its mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. OpenAI conducts research in the field of AI and develops advanced machine learning models, tools, and platforms that are widely used across industries, academia, and by individual developers.
    </p>

    <h2>History and Founding</h2>
    <p>
        OpenAI was founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, and Wojciech Zaremba. The organization began as a non-profit, with the goal of promoting and developing friendly AI in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole. Over time, OpenAI transitioned to a "capped-profit" model to attract funding and scale its research efforts.
